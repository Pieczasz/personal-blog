        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">Why I do what I do?</h2>
        <p className="text-xl">
          I just feel better when I am productive. I really love coding,
          trading, training, and every aspect of my life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          If you ask me how I do it, I will tell you that I don&apos;t know. I
          feel that I was just born to do what I am doing. I created this blog
          to help other teens be productive and motivated to learn and do what
          they feel they should do.

        <p className="text-xl">
          I hope you enjoy it and feel the same as I do. I am not trying to fake
          it and be like those people on TikTok and YouTube who tell you that
          making money is easy, life is easy, and everything will always go as
          you would like it to go.

          I am here to show my perspective on life, work, and how I want to
          become successful.

        <p className="text-xl">
          Here you can see a few random facts about me...
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          My coding journey started in 2023. I first started with Python, then
          learned JS, HTML, and CSS. I was excited about creating websites and
          mobile apps, and then I learned React, which is, I think, the best
          framework for me. I just love creating single components and then
          using them to create one page again and again until I have the full
          website done.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          I started trading at the start of 2023 (right before I started
          learning programming). I was excited by the fact that you can earn so
          much, but you also risk so much at the same time. Therefore, I created
          rules to make my trading consistent and profitable. I am trading to
          become financially free before my 30s.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          At the age of 15, my self-esteem was really low. I was skinny and
          short. and had terrible hairstyles. I was also afraid of being
          rejected. Because of that, I started my journey with gyms and
          training. Since I began going to the gym I&apos;ve been really
          motivated, and I think that I really appreciate myself.
